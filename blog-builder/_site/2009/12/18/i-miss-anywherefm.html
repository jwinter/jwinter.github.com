<p>anywhere.fm was my favorite web application.&nbsp; If you weren't lucky enough to use it while it was around, it was like a Web-based iTunes.&nbsp; You could upload all of your music to it and then play it from anywhere you had an internet connection and a Flash player.&nbsp;</p><p>The UI bore a strong resemblance to iTunes, but its best UI feature was that everything was fast.&nbsp; Searching for a song in your collection was fast, switching to a new playlist was fast, creating a new playlist was fast.&nbsp; There are very few (maybe GMail?) Web apps where I could do what I wanted to as quickly.</p><p>Their import process had two features that I haven't seen anywhere else: a) a convenient desktop app to upload your music in the background and b) the ability to upload <strong>all</strong> of your music.&nbsp; The OS X native app to upload your music worked perfectly for me.&nbsp; It took a few days to get it all, but eventually I had several thousand songs uploaded to anywhere.fm.&nbsp;</p><p>I want to emphasize how happy it made me to have all of my music anywhere I was in front of a computer.</p><p>The anywhere story had a happy ending for the founders, but a sad one for their users.&nbsp; They were bought by imeem, which had an abysmal, sluggish interface and never migrated all of my music.&nbsp; Imeem was then acquired my MySpace Music which claims to have plans to migrate the music from Imeem.&nbsp; But there's no chance MySpace will produce anything like anywhere.</p><p>I'm interested to see what the anywhere founders will build next, but they and YCombinator, the incubator that helped them get started, have lost a bit of my trust.&nbsp; I appreciate their hard work in building anywhere.&nbsp; But I'd like them to understand what it felt like when anywhere was taken away.</p>
