<p><a href="http://movieos.org/blog/2013/rules-for-personal-projects/">http://movieos.org/blog/2013/rules-for-personal-projects/</a></p><p>This makes a lot of sense, I'm often lost when I try to go back to a personal project that I've left off for a few weeks. Something like a "run" bash script that just did "rails s &amp;&amp; open 'http://localhost:3000/last_thing_i_worked_on'" would be good to get started again quickly. And taking the time to deploy the little Clojure projects I've done to heroku would be worthwhile.</p>
