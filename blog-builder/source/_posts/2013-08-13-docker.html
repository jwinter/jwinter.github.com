<p>I gave a short talk on <a href="http://docker.io">Docker</a>
at <a href="http://phillyrb.org">PhillyRB</a>'s August
meeting.  <a href="http://slideshare.net/jwatnj/docker">These were my
slides</a>, although I went way off of them and only got through about
half.</p>

<p>Below are my speech notes.</p>

<h3>What's Docker?</h3>

<h4>3 things I'd like you to take from this talk:</h4>
<ul>
<li> Docker provides a lot of the advantages of virtual machines without the disadvantages
<li> Container-based deployment is a great way to deploy applications
<li> AUFS and LXC are the chocolate and peanut butter that makes Docker so great to use
</ul>

<h4>What's a container?</h4>
<p>It's like a virtual machine. When your app is running inside a
container, it appears to be running inside its own OS But there could
be many other containers running alongside yours, sharing resources It
uses a combination of LXC (Linux containers) and AUFS (A
union/layered/snapshotting filesystem). I'll talk about both more
later</p>

<p>They're also a means of packaging. You can build a container and
run it anywhere that can run docker. You can share that container with
other people and know that it will run the same way.</p>


<h4>Why are they useful?</h4>

<ul>
<li> Run your whole damn stack<br/>
Run your Rails app on your laptop by grabbing a container with RVM
installed, another container with PostgreSQL, another container with
Redis, another with ElasticSearch or Solr.  If you've ever tried to
run multi-node Vagrant, it's really painful and slow to spin up
several nodes. Docker makes it very fast and easy
</li>
<li> Reduce dependencies by shipping dependencies inside the container<br/>
Compile native gems or anything else once inside your container and
ship that everywhere instead of building on each server
</li>
<li> Cut down on configuration errors in production<br/>
Configure your OS inside the container, build, then snapshot.
</li>

<li> They're fast <br/>
Much faster and less resource intensive than VMs.
As we'll see in the demo, you can spin one up almost instantly.
</li>

<li> Deploy Once, Deploy Anywhere<br/>
Once you've built a container, and committed it as an image
you can run it anywhere
</li>

<li>Let someone else do the work for you<br/>
Ability to package and share containers means that you can start from
a known good ubuntu installation with RVM, like sharing chef cookbooks
</li>

<li>Easy to build<br/>
Make a mistake building your application, no problem,
every successful step is automatically snapshotted
If you've ever tried provisioning servers with vagrant you know you're
almost always starting over every time
</li>
</ul>

<h4>What does working with containers look like?</h4>

<h4>How do containers work?</h4>
<h4>LXC</h4>
<ul>
<li>LXC gives you isolation and control over sharing of resources
<li>LXC namespaces are what makes each container appear to have its own networking,
process table, filesystem mount points, and hostname
<li>LXC is also how you say: "Give my Rails container 4GB of RAM, but my
database container 28GB". It gives you some control over resource management including
IO ops/second and bytes per second.
</ul>

<h4>AUFS</h4>

<ul>
<li>AUFS, union or "layering" filesystem
<li>The filesystem layers give each container its own view of the complete
filesystem
<li>Base layer is the OS and is read-only
<li>Your container is read-write on top
<li>When you go to do a read, it hits your container first, then reads
through to the base if you haven't made any changes
<li>Unchanged files are shared</li>
<li>Buffercache is also shared, so a certain portion of what's shared on
disk is shared in memory as well.</li>
<li>This aspect is importants because it improves performance. Storage is
cheap so who really cares that AUFS saves a few gigabytes, but the
fact that most dynamic libraries (like glibc) are shared across
containers in memory means that containers spin up very quickly</li>
</ul>

<h4>Where can I find useful prebuilt containers?</h4>
<ul>
<li>https://index.docker.io/</li>
<li>Search Github for Dockerfiles</li>
</ul>

<h4>How do I build containers?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Dockerfile, like a Gemfile but more like a shell script</li>
<li>You list what image you want to start from, then you list
the commands you want to run, files you want to include, ports you
want to expose</li>
</ul>

<h4>What are the downsides?</h4>
<ul>
<li>New, doesn't feel buggy, just not a lot of good answers yet for common
ops questions like:</li>
<li>What happens a container crashes or the daemon crashes? How to monitor these?</li>
<li>Have to run your own repository to share private docker images</li>
</ul>


<h4>What's the future?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Already several platforms like Heroku are popping up to support running Docker containers</li>
<li>Docker 1.0 in the fall</li>
<li>Like 100 committers on it and they just opensourced it</li>
<li>Docker is already changning how people ship software</li>
<li>Do MUCH less configuration in Chef, ship almost entirely configured containers</li>
<li>Test Chef recipes very quickly with test-kitchen-docker</li>
<li>Continuous Integration, test app inside lightweight container, ship
that container</li>
</ul>
