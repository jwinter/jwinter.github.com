  <div class="entry-content"><p>I gave a short talk on <a href="http://docker.io">Docker</a>
at <a href="http://phillyrb.org">PhillyRB</a>&#8217;s August
meeting.  <a href="http://slideshare.net/jwatnj/docker">These were my
slides</a>, although I went way off of them and only got through about
half. What follows are the notes I used for my talk.</p>

<h3>What&#8217;s Docker?</h3>

<h4>3 things I&#8217;d like you to take from this talk:</h4>
<ul>
<li> Docker provides a lot of the advantages of virtual machines without the disadvantages
<li> Container-based deployment is a great way to deploy applications
<li> AUFS and LXC are the chocolate and peanut butter that makes Docker so great to use
</ul>

<h4>What&#8217;s a container?</h4>
<p>It&#8217;s like a virtual machine. When your app is running inside a
container, it appears to be running inside its own OS. But there could
be many other containers running alongside yours, all sharing
resources. It uses a combination of LXC (Linux containers) and AUFS (A
union/layered/snapshotting filesystem). I&#8217;ll talk about both more
later</p>

<p>They&#8217;re also a means of packaging. You can build a container and
run it anywhere that can run docker. You can share that container with
other people and know that it will run the same way.</p>


<h4>Why are they useful?</h4>

<ul>
<li> Run your whole damn stack<br/>
Run your Rails app on your laptop by grabbing a container with RVM
installed, another container with PostgreSQL, another container with
Redis, another with ElasticSearch or Solr.  If you&#8217;ve ever tried to
run multi-node Vagrant, it&#8217;s really painful and slow to spin up
several nodes. Docker makes it very fast and easy.
</li>
<li> Reduce dependencies by shipping dependencies inside the container<br/>
Compile native gems or anything else once inside your container and
ship that everywhere instead of building on each server.
</li>
<li> Cut down on configuration errors in production<br/>
Configure your OS inside the container then snapshot.
</li>

<li> They&#8217;re fast <br/>
Much faster and less resource intensive than VMs.
As we&#8217;ll see in the demo, you can spin one up almost instantly.
</li>

<li> Deploy Once, Deploy Anywhere<br/>
Once you&#8217;ve built a container, and committed it as an image
you can run it anywhere
</li>

<li>Let someone else do the work for you<br/> 
The ability to package and share containers means that you can use
someone else&#8217;s work to start from a known functional state. It&#8217;s like
sharing chef cookbooks.
</li>

<li>Easy to build<br/>
Make a mistake building your application, no problem,
every successful step is automatically snapshotted.
If you&#8217;ve ever tried provisioning VMs with vagrant you know you&#8217;re
almost always starting over every time.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>What does working with containers look like?</h4>
<p>Demo goes here.</p>

<h4>How do containers work?</h4>
<h4>LXC</h4>
<ul>
<li>LXC gives you isolation and control over sharing of resources
<li>LXC namespaces are what makes each container appear to have its own networking,
process table, filesystem mount points, and hostname
<li>LXC is also how you say: &#8220;Give my Rails container 4GB of RAM, but my
database container 28GB&#8221;. It gives you some control over resource management including
IO ops/second and bytes per second.
</ul>

<h4>AUFS</h4>

<ul>
<li>AUFS, union or &#8220;layering&#8221; filesystem
<li>The filesystem layers give each container its own view of the complete
filesystem
<li>Base layer is the OS and is read-only
<li>Your container is read-write on top
<li>When you go to do a read, it hits your container first, then reads
through to the base if you haven&#8217;t made any changes
<li>Unchanged files are shared</li>
<li>Buffercache is also shared, so a certain portion of what&#8217;s shared on
disk is shared in memory as well.</li>
<li>This aspect is importants because it improves performance. Storage is
cheap, so who really cares that AUFS saves a few gigabytes, but the
fact that many dynamic libraries are shared across
containers in memory means that containers spin up very quickly.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Where can I find useful prebuilt containers?</h4>
<ul>
<li>https://index.docker.io/</li>
<li>Search Github for Dockerfiles</li>
</ul>

<h4>How do I build containers?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Dockerfile, like a Gemfile but more like a shell script</li>
<li>You list what image you want to start from, then you list
the commands you want to run, files you want to include, ports you
want to expose</li>
</ul>

<h4>What are the downsides?</h4>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s very new, but doesn&#8217;t feel buggy. There&#8217;s just not a lot of good answers yet for common
ops questions like what happens a container crashes or the daemon crashes or how to monitor?</li>
<li>Have to run your own repository to share private docker images</li>
</ul>


<h4>What&#8217;s the future?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Already several platforms like Heroku are popping up to support running Docker containers</li>
<li>Docker 1.0 in the fall</li>
<li>Like 100 committers on it and they just opensourced it</li>
<li>Docker is already changing how people ship software</li>
<li>Do MUCH less configuration in Chef, ship almost entirely configured containers</li>
<li>Test Chef recipes very quickly with test-kitchen-docker</li>
<li>Continuous Integration, test app inside lightweight container, ship
that container</li>
</ul>

Something like a &#8220;run&#8221; bash script that just did &#8220;rails s &amp;&amp; open &#8216;http://localhost:3000/last_thing_i_worked_on&#8217;&#8221; would be good to get started again quickly. And taking the time to deploy the little Clojure projects I&#8217;ve done to heroku would be worthwhile.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There is a limit on the number of running eventmachine timers you can use at one time. &nbsp;And cancelling a timer does *not* free up one of those slots for running timers, you must wait until the time when the timer would actually fire to free up a slot.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>anywhere.fm was my favorite web application.&nbsp; If you weren&#8217;t lucky enough to use it while it was around, it was like a Web-based iTunes.&nbsp; You could upload all of your music to it and then play it from anywhere you had an internet connection and a Flash player.&nbsp;</p><p>The UI bore a strong resemblance to iTunes, but its best UI feature was that everything was fast.&nbsp; Searching for a song in your collection was fast, switching to a new playlist was fast, creating a new playlist was fast.&nbsp; There are very few (maybe GMail?) Web apps where I could do what I wanted to as quickly.</p><p>Their import process had two features that I haven&#8217;t seen anywhere else: a) a convenient desktop app to upload your music in the background and b) the ability to upload <strong>all</strong> of your music.&nbsp; The OS X native app to upload your music worked perfectly for me.&nbsp; It took a few days to get it all, but eventually I had several thousand songs uploaded to anywhere.fm.&nbsp;</p><p>I want to emphasize how happy it made me to have all of my music anywhere I was in front of a computer.</p><p>The anywhere story had a happy ending for the founders, but a sad one for their users.&nbsp; They were bought by imeem, which had an abysmal, sluggish interface and never migrated all of my music.&nbsp; Imeem was then acquired my MySpace Music which claims to have plans to migrate the music from Imeem.&nbsp; But there&#8217;s no chance MySpace will produce anything like anywhere.</p><p>I&#8217;m interested to see what the anywhere founders will build next, but they and YCombinator, the incubator that helped them get started, have lost a bit of my trust.&nbsp; I appreciate their hard work in building anywhere.&nbsp; But I&#8217;d like them to understand what it felt like when anywhere was taken away.</p>
